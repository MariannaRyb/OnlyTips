# OnlyTips

Universe of cryptocurrencies and blockchain these days is considered to be the bleeding
edge of technology and for that reason our team decided to delve into the sphere.
In many countries with mature economy touchless tips have been raising the popularity
during the last several years due to several reasons that are discussed in great details in the coursework report.
However, the number of them based on blockchain is exiguous, especially in context of Russia.
That is why we decided to create the tips service based on blockchain. 

A fully-featured website
was made containing the database of both tippers and tippees, profile pages, transaction page,
"about us" page and etc. By clicking the "Tip" button on the website and choosing the receiverâ€˜s
crypto wallet address with the amount one desire to send, a connection with the smart-contract is
being set and thus, a transaction through the blockchain is made. 


In order to have own currency
we have created an Ethereum based token "OnlyTipsToken" (OTT), smart-contracts for which
are ERC20 standardized. Additionally, we have implemented several features for the token that
are going to be discussed later.


To sum up, we have created a working blockchain based tips service that is aimed at a
concept of a waiter-visitor relation. In other words, for now we have a service for restaurants and
cafes where visitors may tip waiters for their well done job
